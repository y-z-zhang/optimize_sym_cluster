# optimize_sym_cluster
This is a simulated annealing algorithm to improve network synchronizability through minimal link rewiring, removal, or addition.

It includes:

1. optimize_eigratio_rewire.m

  Matlab implementation of a simulated annealing algorithm that optimizes network synchronizability through minimal link rewiring.
  
2. optimize_eigratio_remove.m

  Matlab implementation of a simulated annealing algorithm that optimizes network synchronizability through minimal link removal.
  
3. optimize_eigratio_add.m

  Matlab implementation of a simulated annealing algorithm that optimizes network synchronizability through minimal link addition.
  
4. Network1.txt

  Adjacency matrix of the 16-node network used as an example in the three implementations.
